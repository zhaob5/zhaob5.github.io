A night of laughter, friendship, and new beginnings.

Cherishing a final night before parting ways
======

Before leaving Baltimore, I gathered with close friends for one final dinner together. It was a simple evening — good food, familiar faces, quiet smiles. Yet, beneath that simplicity was a deep sense of gratitude for the years we had shared.

Friendships formed here will stay with me, even as we each move on to new chapters. Thank you, Baltimore, for the memories — and to my friends, for making this city feel like home.
