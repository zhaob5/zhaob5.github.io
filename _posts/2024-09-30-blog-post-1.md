The Joy of Meeting With Old Friends Again.

Always feels good to see old friends again
======

There’s something special about walking back onto campus after years: the familiar buildings, the fall air in Troy, and the memories of late-night projects and early-morning lectures. Attending RPI’s 200th Anniversary wasn’t just a celebration of the school’s history, but also a celebration of the friendships forged here.
<br>
<br>
Catching up with old friends always feels good, as if no time had passed. We shared stories, laughed over old jokes, and marveled at how far we’ve all come since our student days. These moments reminded me that while the years change us, the bonds we built in college still remain strong.
<br>
<br>
Here’s to RPI, to 200 years of innovation, and to the friendships that make it unforgettable.
