From Scalpel-Ready Robots to Startup Dreams
======

Fresh out of Johns Hopkins, with a degree and an unshakable passion for medical robotics, I’ve spent the past two years designing systems that help surgeons perform incredibly delicate procedures. It’s been a rewarding mix of precision engineering, clever algorithms, and the occasional late-night “aha” moment — all fueled by equal parts curiosity and caffeine. Next, I’ll be joining Nautilus X-Ray, an innovative healthcare startup, as a Staff Mechanical Engineer, where I’ll help push the boundaries of imaging technology. My long-term goal? To grow into one of the best robotics engineers in the world - building machines that make a real difference in people’s lives.
