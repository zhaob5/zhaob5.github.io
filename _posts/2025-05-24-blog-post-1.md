Friendship is Magic
======

There’s a certain magic to revisiting familiar places — not just in seeing the sights, but in reconnecting with the people who once made them feel like home. This trip along the East Coast was exactly that: a joyful loop through cities rich in history, culture, and friendship.
<br>
<br>
But the real highlight wasn’t the scenery - it was the people. Friends I hadn’t seen in years greeted me as if no time had passed at all. We shared meals, swapped stories, and laughed until it hurt. These moments reminded me that true friendship doesn’t fade; it simply waits for the next reunion.
<br>
<br>
By the end, the trip wasn’t just a collection of destinations, but a patchwork of smiles, conversations, and memories that will stick with me far longer than the miles I traveled.
