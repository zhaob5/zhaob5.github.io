Hi there! My name is **Botao Zhao**. I'm currently a **Staff Mechanical Engineer** at **[Nautilus X-Ray](https://www.nautilusxray.com/)**, an R&D company specializing in the design and prototyping of CT scanners and related technologies. I'm also a part-time **Research Assistant** at **[AMIRo](https://amiro.lcsr.jhu.edu/)** Research Lab.

I received my Master's degree in Robotics from **Johns Hopkins University**, where I worked with [Dr. Iulian Iordachita](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/iulian-iordachita/) in the AMIRo Research Lab. I also earned dual Bachelor’s degrees in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, along with a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, from **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute**, where I worked with [Dr. Daniel Walczyk](https://faculty.rpi.edu/daniel-walczyk) in the Manufacturing Innovation Learning Lab.

A Passionate Aero/Mech/Robotics Engineer
======
I’ve always been fascinated by machinery and robotics - basically anything with gears, motors, sensors and code that makes stuff move. From building competition robots at robot club to interning at a cutting-edge medical equipment company, from helping teach robotics courses to diving deep into research projects, each step has strengthened my skills and deepened my passion. Along the way, I’ve learned how to turn ambitious ideas into real solutions - and to have fun doing it. You can check out some of my favorite **[Projects](/projects/)**.

Designing Motion: My Path to Robotics
======
From 2016 to 2021, I completed a rigorous five-year combined Bachelor’s and Master’s program in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This foundation strengthened my ‘mechanical and soft’ skills, covering areas like engineering design, data analysis, critical thinking, and teamwork. With every engineering course I took, my desire to become a robotics engineer solidified - I wanted to solve real-world challenges with cutting-edge technology. Yet, I also realized I’d only scratched the surface of the field, sparking an eagerness to delve deeper into robotics.

From 2021 to 2023, I pursued my second Master’s degree in medical robotics at Johns Hopkins, developing my technical knowledge, research methodology, and innovative mindset. Under Professor Iulian Iordachita’s guidance at the AMIRo Lab, my research has focused on EyeRobot3.0, a collaborative robot for eye surgery. I implemented a virtual remote center of motion control to limit the robot’s scleral force, safeguarding delicate vessels during surgery. This work has led to two papers presented at the <i>2023 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication</i> ([RO-MAN 2023](https://ro-man2023.org/main)) and the <i>2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</i> ([ICRA 2024](https://2024.ieee-icra.org/)), where I explored the advantages of assistive robotic solutions for less-experienced surgeons in vitreoretinal surgery. This research experience has solidified my knowledge of engineering and motivated me to continue learning and pursuing challenging goals. I have also been fortunate to work with many talented researchers, whose ideas and attitudes have further inspired me to pursue excellence in robotics. I am committed to lifelong learning and am determined to achieve my dream of becoming a great engineer.

In July 2023, I joined Nautilus X-Ray, an innovative medical imaging startup in Las Vegas dedicated to redefining the future of E-Beam CT technology. As a Staff Engineer, I contribute to pioneering hardware design, validation, testing, and optimization, working alongside a team of exceptional talent. Together, we are driven to create an ultra-fast, game-changing CT imaging platform that integrates cutting-edge advancements to transform the landscape of medical diagnostics. Our work, "<i>Developing a Novel X-Ray Source and a 6th Generation Ultra-Fast and General-Purpose CT</i>", will be presented at Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America ([RSNA 2025](https://www.rsna.org/annual-meeting)), showcasing our breakthrough approach in CT system design and imaging performance.

In 2025, I volunteer as a remote research assistant at JHU, where I derived and verified the closed-form solutions for the forward and inverse kinematics, as well as the Jacobian, of SHER-3.0, a 5-DOF cooperative robot designed for eye surgery. Our latest work, "<i>A Hybrid Surgical Robotic System for High-Dexterity Vitreoretinal Surgery</i>", has been submitted to ICRA 2026, and we are also preparing additional research papers for ISMR 2026 and Robotica to showcase more of our work.
