excerpt: 'We presents an analytical kinematic framework for a hybrid parallel–serial robot designed for retinal surgery, as well as analytical formulations of the direct and inverse Jacobians. The kinematic performance is analyzed to evaluate the manipulability and workspace efficiency. Building on these models, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is implemented.'

This work presents, for the first time, a thorough analytical forward and inverse kinematics and Jacobian models for the SHER 3.0, with a Delta-based parallel-serial mechanism. Based on these analytical models, a MPC algorithm is designed to maintain a RCM constraint at eye sclerotomy during robot-assisted retinal microsurgical procedures. A kinematics analysis is performed to calculate the reachable and dexterous workspaces of the robot. Moreover, the manipulability performance of the SHER 3.0 is evaluated across the robot’s joint space and end-effector task space. Finally, the accuracy of the MPCbased controller in enforcing the RCM constraint is evaluated in a pilot study of a teleportation experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed kinematics and Jacobian models, together with the MPC control algorithm, satisfy clinical requirements for RCM accuracy, providing a safe and precise robot-assisted retinal surgery platform with robust control performance.
