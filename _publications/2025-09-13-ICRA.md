excerpt: 'In this work, we developed a high-dexterity vitreoretinal robotic system composed of a 5-DoF base robot (BR) integrated with a 2-DoF snake robot (SR). A combined teleoperation control framework is implemented to provide an intuitive control strategy using the Omega 7 haptic interface.'

This work develops a hybrid surgical robotic system with seven degrees of freedom (7-DoF), including a 5-DoF base robot (BR), integrated with a 2-DoF snake robot (SR) at the distal end, aiming to perform epiretinal membrane (ERM) peeling, safely and efficiently, with optimum approach angle. A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is designed to satisfy a remote center of motion (RCM) constraint for the BR at the sclerotomy port, while controlling the SR at the distal end. The accuracy of the robot's kinematics and MPC controller for the RCM constraint and the tool's approach angle to the retina surface is measured and analyzed in an artificial eye phantom. Moreover, the performance of the hybrid robotic platform is evaluated in a pilot study with five users, in a teleoperation experiment targeting a random order of target points, with and without the use of the SR. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in users' performance in terms of task completion time, counts of clutch activations, and success rate, while using the hybrid system (BR $\&$ SR) compared to the case using only the BR.
