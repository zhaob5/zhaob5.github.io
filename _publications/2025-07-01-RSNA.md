Ultra-Fast, such as Cardiac, CT performance has been limited by a half century old 3 rd generation CT design enabled by the rotating anode X-ray tube technology. The necessity to rotate the X-Ray source with its power supply limits the (rotation) speed of the 3 rd generation CT. We have developed a novel X-Ray source technology, referred to as the Magnetically-Scanning Stationary (MSS) X-Ray source together with a rotation detector array CT platform. The combination of the MSS X-Ray source and the rotating detector array is referred to as the 6th generation CT.
