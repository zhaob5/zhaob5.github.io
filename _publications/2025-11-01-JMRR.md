In this work, the simulator is developed within the Asynchronous Multi-body Framework (AMBF) to allow for the use of maximal coordinates to model the robot constraints. An optimization-based controller is employed to achieve teleoperation of the SHER 3.0 in simulation. The results of the comparison study between the physical robot and simulation indicate kinematic accuracy of the simulator as well as similar levels of task performance and mental load during teleoperation.
