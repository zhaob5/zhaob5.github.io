This project involves the design and fabrication of a passive 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) support platform tailored for an eye surgical robot. The platform provides surgeons with precise, adaptable positioning, making it easier to set up the robotic system in any operating room. Its flexibility streamlines deployment, enhancing the robot's accessibility and functionality across varied surgical setups, thereby contributing to improved workflow and patient outcomes in ophthalmic procedures.
