This project presents a simplified control strategy for Virtual Remote Center of Motion (V-RCM), implemented in C++. The method uses admittance control to enable precise and intuitive manipulation, allowing users to define the center of rotation dynamically on the sclera during eye surgery. 

By decoupling the control from a fixed mechanical pivot, the system enhances dexterity and flexibility, which is particularly beneficial in delicate microsurgical applications.
