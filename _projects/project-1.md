The Magnetic Field Mapper is a 3 DOF Cartesian moving platform equipped with a Hall Probe (SENIS F3A Magnetic Field Transducer) for measuring magnetic fields. It is designed for mapping the magnetic field of coils. The system utilizes three stepper motors for linear motion in the x, y, and z directions and is controlled by a Python script running on an OpenBuilds CNC controller (BlackBox X32).
