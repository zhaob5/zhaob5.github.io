This project showcases a custom-designed X-Ray Detector Module constructed with lightweight sheet metal. The detectors are arranged in a grid configuration to optimize imaging resolution. Unique to this design is its adjustable curvature, achieved by swapping two precision-engineered curved plates, allowing for easy adaptability to different imaging requirements. The module's lightweight construction further enhances its versatility, making it well-suited for diverse applications in dynamic X-ray environments.>
