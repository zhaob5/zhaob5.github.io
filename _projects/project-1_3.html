This project implements Bernstein polynomial approximation to achieve high-precision gravity compensation for SHER-3.0. The goal is to eliminate unwanted tool drift or movement resulting from gravitational forces, particularly in systems operating under admittance control.

By accurately modeling the gravity-induced torque using Bernstein polynomials, the control system ensures more stable tool behavior, contributing to safer and more predictable interaction during delicate tasks such as retinal surgery.
