This GUI provides an intuitive interface for running CT simulations and reconstructions with digital phantoms using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/xcist" target="_blank">XCIST</a> toolkit. Users can select phantom, protocol, scanner, and reconstruction configurations, run simulations, and visualize sinograms and reconstructed images â€” all within a single window. Console outputs are captured in real-time for easy monitoring. The project will be available on GitHub soon, making it accessible for teaching, experimentation, and rapid prototyping of CT imaging workflows.
