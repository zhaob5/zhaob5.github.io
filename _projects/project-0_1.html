An FBP-based short-scan reconstruction algorithm within X-ray-based Cancer Imaging Simulation Toolkit (XCIST) using Parker/Silver’s weighting function, enabling flexible simulation and reconstruction for arbitrary scan ranges beyond standard half-scan. The results were used to supported design decisions for a compact CT system by providing quantitative evaluation of short-scan imaging performance.

Developed based on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/xcist" target="_blank">XCIST</a> toolkit. Users can select phantom, protocol, scanner, and reconstruction configurations, run simulations, and visualize sinograms and reconstructed images — all within a single window. Console outputs are captured in real-time for easy monitoring. The project will be available on GitHub soon, making it accessible for teaching, experimentation, and rapid prototyping of CT imaging workflows.
