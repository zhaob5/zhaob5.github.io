This project focuses on the integration of a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based force sensor embedded within the tool shaft of SHER-3.0. The sensor was tested to accurately measure tool-to-trocar interaction forces, a key factor in maintaining tool stability and safety during surgical procedures.

The collected force data supports a force-minimization control strategy, helping reduce undesired contact forces between the tool and the scleral entry point, ultimately enhancing patient safety during vitreoretinal surgery.
