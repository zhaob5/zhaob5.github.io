This project presents a detailed derivations and explanations of the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, Jacobian, and Jacobian Inverse analysis for the SHER-3.0 surgical robot. It includes analytical computation results in Python, validation through SolidWorks motion simulation. Details are avaliable on my github: https://github.com/zhaob5/sher3-kinematics
