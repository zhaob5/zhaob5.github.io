This project presents a scaled model of a CT scanner, incorporating a brake rotor, step motor, laser tachometer, and vibration sensor. The model is designed to simulate high-stress operating conditions to analyze and improve dynamic balancing. By studying vibration patterns and rotational behavior under extreme scenarios, this model aims to advance understanding of stability and performance factors critical to high-speed rotating systems, such as CT scanners.
